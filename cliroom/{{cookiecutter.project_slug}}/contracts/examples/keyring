  This is a long description for a chain that executes two smart contracts
  and pass the output of the first as the `keys` input of the next one
steps:
  - id: keyring
    zencode: |-
      Scenario ecdh: create the keypair at user creation 
      Given nothing
      When I create the ecdh key
      Then print keyring
  - id: public
    keysFromStep: keyring
    zencode: |-
      rule caller restroom-mw
      Scenario 'ecdh': Read things
      Given Argument [keyring]: The keyring for your format
      Given I have the 'keyring'
      When I create the ecdh public key
      Then print the 'ecdh public key' 
      Then print the 'keyring'
