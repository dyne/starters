# Dyne.org's project starters

We do like to reinvent the wheel... But sometimes it's easier to start with some previous work done!
This repo takes inspiration from https://github.com/spinspire/recipes but in place of 
`degitting` everywhere sometimes more inclined to ease the project creation with 
[`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
