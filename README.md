# Dyne.org's project starters

We do like to reinvent the wheel... But sometimes it's easier to start with some previous work done!
This repo takes inspiration from https://github.com/spinspire/recipes but in place of
`degitting` everywhere sometimes more inclined to ease the project creation with
[`cruft`](https://github.com/cruft/cruft).

## Setup

Please make sure to have these installed:

- [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#installation)

# The starters

## cliroom

🛠️ CLI builder that runs Zencode smart contracts

```bash
cruft create --directory cliroom https://github.com/dyne/starters
```


## saas

This is the starter for saas products. A fullstack app made of:

- `admin` – the backoffice for the site admins (configurations, logs, users)
- `webapp` – the ui and pages of your SAAS service

**Installation**

```
cruft create --directory saas https://github.com/dyne/starters
```

**Update your project with the starter upgrades**

To update an existing project, that was created using cruft, run cruft update 
in the root of the project. If there are any updates, cruft will have you 
review them before applying. If you accept the changes cruft will apply them to
your project and update the .cruft.json file for you.
